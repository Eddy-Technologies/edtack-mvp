# Credit System Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from Stripe balance-based system to internal credit system to avoid e-money/payment institution regulation.

## Database Changes

### New Tables Created
1. **user_credits** - Internal credit balances
   - `user_info_id` (FK to user_infos)
   - `credit` (INTEGER, balance in cents)
   - `updated_at` (auto-updated timestamp)

2. **task_credit** - Task-based credit earning system
   - Parent creates tasks with credit rewards
   - Child completes tasks and gets approval
   - Automatic credit awarding on approval
   - Comprehensive status tracking and notes

### Modified Tables
- **credit_transactions** - Made Stripe fields optional, added `is_internal` flag and `task_credit_id` reference

## API Changes

### Removed Endpoints
- `/api/credits/balance.get.ts` (Stripe balance)
- `/api/credits/transfer.post.ts` (Stripe balance transfer)
- `/api/credits/success.get.ts` (Stripe balance top-up)

### New Endpoints
- `/api/credits/internal-balance.get.ts` - Get internal credit balance
- `/api/credits/internal-transfer.post.ts` - Transfer internal credits between parent/child
- `/api/tasks/create.post.ts` - Create tasks with credit rewards
- `/api/tasks/list.get.ts` - List tasks (parent and child views)
- `/api/tasks/complete.post.ts` - Child marks task as completed
- `/api/tasks/approve.post.ts` - Parent approves/rejects completed tasks

### Modified Endpoints
- `/api/credits/unified.get.ts` - Now uses internal credits instead of Stripe balance
- `/api/shop/purchase.post.ts` - Uses internal credits for purchases
- `/api/webhooks/stripe.post.ts` - Adds to internal credits instead of Stripe balance

## Key Features

### Task System
- Parents create tasks with credit rewards
- Children complete tasks and add completion notes
- Parents approve/reject with approval notes
- Automatic credit awarding on approval
- Full audit trail with timestamps

### Credit Management
- Internal credit balances (no money held in Stripe)
- Parent-to-child credit transfers
- Purchase using internal credits
- Credit top-up still uses Stripe (adds to internal balance)

### Regulatory Compliance
- No money holding - Stripe only processes payments
- Clear transaction flow - payment happens at point of purchase
- Internal credits are non-monetary rewards system
- Reduces e-money/payment institution regulation risk

## Migration Files
1. `migrations_credit_system.sql` - Main database structure
2. `add_operation_codes.sql` - New operation type codes

## Next Steps
1. Run database migrations in Supabase
2. Test the new system thoroughly
3. Update any remaining frontend components
4. Consider adding email notifications for task completion/approval
5. Add parent payment approval flow for purchases (future enhancement)

✅ No regulatory compliance issues (no money holding)  
✅ Simple internal credit system  
✅ Task-based earning mechanism  
✅ Clear audit trail  
✅ Stripe only processes actual payments  
✅ Parent control over child spending
