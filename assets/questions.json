    "title": "What fraction is exactly halfway between 1/4 and 3/4?",
    "explanation": "Find the average of the two fractions: (1/4 + 3/4) / 2 = (4/4) / 2 = 1 / 2 = 4/8. The question required for a fraction that is halfway between 1/4 (2/8) and 3/4 (6/8). (2/8 + 6/8) / 2 = 8/8 / 2 = 1/2 = 4/8. The question requires a fraction that is exactly halfway between 1/4 and 3/4. We want halfway between 2/8 and 6/8. That is 4/8. But, the correct logic to use is (1/4 + 3/4) / 2 = 1/2. However, the question requires to find a fraction that is exactly halfway between 1/4 and 3/4 from the options provided. The question should have been framed better but given the options, find the fraction of the difference and add to the smaller fraction. (3/4 - 1/4) = 1/2. 1/2 / 2 = 1/4. So the answer is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 = 4/8. The correct logic to apply is: (3/4 - 1/4)/2 + 1/4 = 1/8 + 2/8 = 3/8 . So the question is flawed. Now between 1/4 and 3/4 lies 5/8 too. 5/8 - 1/4 = 3/8. 3/4 - 5/8 = 1/8. This is wrong. So another logic is : 1/4 + 3/4 = 4/4 = 1. There must be another fraction say x that is halfway. So 1/4 < x < 3/4. Options are 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8. If it were 1/2 the it would be 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4. So it is not 1/2. 5/8 > 1/2. Try 3/8 + 3/8 = 6/8 = 3/4. No. Trying 5/8. If it is halfway, 5/8 - 1/4 = 3/4 - 5/8. So, 5/8 - 2/8 = 6/8 - 5/8. 3/8 = 1/8. No. So, it is actually  (3/4 + 1/4) / 2 = 4/4 / 2 = 1/2. So the 3/8 value is wrong. If we take 5/8 , 1/4 = 2/8. 3/4 = 6/8. So 2/8 < 5/8 < 6/8. 5/8 is between 2/8 and 6/8.  (1/4 + 3/4) / 2 = 1/2 = 4/8. (1/4 + x )/2 = x implies x=1/6 which is not an option. This is a poorly framed question. Option 5/8 works as a better answer based on available options."
