# Custom Stripe Checkout Implementation Guide

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete custom Stripe checkout flow for your subscription system instead of using Stripe's hosted checkout. This gives you full control over the user experience while maintaining secure payment processing.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints

#### Subscription Management APIs
- `/api/subscription/cancel.post.ts` - Cancel subscription at period end
- `/api/subscription/upgrade.post.ts` - Upgrade between subscription plans
- `/api/subscription/update-payment-method.post.ts` - Update payment methods
- `/api/subscription/custom-checkout.post.ts` - Initialize custom checkout with Setup Intent
- `/api/subscription/confirm.post.ts` - Confirm subscription after payment method setup

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Custom Checkout Page
- `/app/pages/subscription/custom-checkout.vue` - Complete custom checkout experience
- Stripe Elements integration for secure card input
- Real-time form validation
- Error handling and loading states
- Terms and conditions acceptance

#### Enhanced SubscriptionTab Component
- **Cancel Subscription**: Modal with cancellation reasons
- **Upgrade Plans**: Direct upgrade from monthly to yearly
- **Billing Management**: Integration with custom and Stripe portal
- **Payment Method Updates**: Through custom APIs

#### Updated Composables
- **useStripe.ts**: Extended with custom checkout and subscription management
- **useSubscription.ts**: Already supports the new backend APIs

### 3. Key Features

#### Custom Checkout Flow
1. User selects plan → redirects to custom checkout
2. Setup Intent created for payment method
3. Stripe Elements for secure card collection
4. Payment method confirmation
5. Subscription creation via API
6. Redirect to dashboard with success

#### Subscription Management
- **Cancel**: Set to cancel at period end (maintains access)
- **Upgrade**: Immediate upgrade with prorated billing
- **Payment Updates**: Secure payment method management
- **Billing Portal**: Falls back to Stripe's portal when needed

## 🔄 Flow Comparison

### Before (Stripe Hosted Checkout)
```
User → Stripe Checkout → Webhook → Database
```

### After (Custom Checkout)
```
User → Custom Form → Setup Intent → Subscription API → Database
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Custom Implementation

1. **Brand Control**: Complete UI/UX control matching your design
2. **Flexibility**: Custom business logic and validation
3. **Better UX**: No external redirects, seamless experience
4. **Enhanced Features**: Custom upgrade/downgrade flows
5. **Data Collection**: Capture additional user preferences

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **PCI Compliance**: Stripe Elements handles sensitive card data
- **No Card Storage**: Payment methods stored securely by Stripe
- **Webhook Verification**: All webhook events are verified
- **Setup Intents**: Secure payment method collection
- **API Authentication**: All APIs require user authentication

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Direct Stripe API vs Supabase Extension

**Recommendation: Direct Stripe API** (Current Implementation)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over checkout flow
- ✅ Custom business logic
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Flexible integration patterns
- ✅ No additional abstraction layer

**Cons:**
- ❌ More code to maintain
- ❌ Need to handle Stripe updates manually

**Supabase Stripe Extension:**
- ✅ Simplified setup
- ✅ Built-in webhook handling
- ❌ Limited customization
- ❌ Less control over checkout flow
- ❌ Harder to implement custom features

## 📋 Usage Examples

### 1. Custom Checkout
```typescript
// From any component
const { handleCustomCheckout } = useStripe();

const startCheckout = () => {
  const planDetails = {
    name: 'Premium Plan',
    price: 29,
    interval: 'month'
  };
  handleCustomCheckout('premium_monthly', planDetails);
};
```

### 2. Cancel Subscription
```typescript
const { cancelSubscription } = useStripe();

const cancel = async () => {
  const response = await cancelSubscription('Too expensive');
  if (response.success) {
    // Handle success
  }
};
```

### 3. Upgrade Plan
```typescript
const { upgradeSubscription } = useStripe();

const upgrade = async () => {
  const response = await upgradeSubscription('premium_yearly');
  if (response.success) {
    // Handle success
  }
};
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

If you want to test both approaches:

1. **Custom Checkout**: Use the new `/subscription/custom-checkout` route
2. **Stripe Checkout**: Keep existing `/subscription` page for comparison
3. **A/B Testing**: Route users to different checkout experiences

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test Payment Flow**: Test with Stripe test cards
2. **Webhook Testing**: Ensure all webhook events are handled
3. **Error Handling**: Add user-friendly error messages
4. **Success Messages**: Add toast notifications for actions

### Future Enhancements
1. **Payment Method Management**: Add full card management UI
2. **Billing History**: Custom billing history page
3. **Invoice Downloads**: Direct invoice access
4. **Coupon/Promo Codes**: Add discount code support
5. **Multi-Currency**: Support for different currencies

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode)
- **Success**: `4242424242424242`
- **Decline**: `4000000000000002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000002500003155`

### Test Scenarios
1. Subscribe → Cancel → Verify access until period end
2. Monthly → Yearly upgrade → Verify prorated billing
3. Payment failure → Update payment method
4. Webhook failures → Retry mechanisms

## 📚 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set:
```bash
NUXT_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NUXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```
