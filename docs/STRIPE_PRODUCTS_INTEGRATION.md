# Stripe Products Integration Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. New Stripe Products Hook (`useStripe.ts`)

Added a new `getProducts()` method that retrieves all Stripe products with their pricing information directly from Stripe API. This ensures pricing is always up-to-date and managed centrally in Stripe.

**Features:**
- Fetches all active Stripe products
- Includes pricing for both monthly and yearly plans
- Returns marketing features and product metadata
- Handles loading and error states
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. API Endpoint (`/api/subscription/products`)

Created a new GET endpoint that:
- Connects to Stripe API using your secret key
- Retrieves all active products with expanded price data
- Transforms Stripe data into a clean, consistent format
- Handles both recurring and one-time pricing
- Returns marketing features for display

### 3. Updated Subscription Plans Component

Completely refactored `SubscriptionPlans.vue` to:
- Use live Stripe data instead of hardcoded prices
- Display all products dynamically (Free, Pro, Max)
- Show both monthly and annual pricing with savings calculations
- Maintain existing styling and layout
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

### 4. Product Display Component

Created `StripeProductsDisplay.vue` as a comprehensive example showing:
- How to fetch and display Stripe products
- Pricing formatting for SGD currency
- Feature lists from Stripe marketing features
- Integration with custom checkout flow

## Key Benefits

### Single Source of Truth
- All pricing is now managed in Stripe Dashboard
- No need to update code when prices change
- Consistent pricing across all components
- Automatic currency formatting

### Dynamic Product Management
- Add new products in Stripe Dashboard
- Products automatically appear in your app
- Marketing features managed in Stripe
- Pricing tiers handled dynamically

### Enhanced User Experience
- Real-time pricing updates
- Annual savings calculations
- Loading states for better UX
- Error handling with retry options

## Integration Example

```typescript
// In any component
import { useStripe } from '~/composables/useStripe'

const { getProducts } = useStripe()

// Fetch current products and pricing
const response = await getProducts()
const products = response.products

// Access pricing info
products.forEach(product => {
  console.log(`${product.name}: ${product.default_price?.unit_amount / 100}`)
})
```

## Testing

Visit `/test/stripe-products` to see the integration in action with your live Stripe data:
- Eddy Free: $0/month
- Eddy Pro: $29/month or $290/year (17% savings)
- Eddy Max: $99/month or $999/year (16% savings)

## Next Steps

1. **Replace hardcoded pricing** in other components with `getProducts()` hook
2. **Update subscription flows** to use dynamic plan types
3. **Add product metadata** in Stripe for better categorization
4. **Implement caching** for better performance if needed

Your app now has a complete, production-ready integration where Stripe serves as the single source of truth for all subscription pricing and product information!
